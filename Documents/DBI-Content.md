## About

### Our Mission
Delta Bay Impact empowers African American youth and families by addressing educational inequity through mentorship, advocacy, and culturally responsive support systems.
### Our Vision
Communities where African American students feel safe, supported, and confident—thriving academically, socially, and emotionally, with clear pathways to college, careers, and income mobility.
### Our Values
- Youth-Centeredness: Students’ voices and experiences guide our work.
- Belonging and empowerment: Identity, culture, and connection matter.
- Collaboration: Schools, families, and communities work best together.
- Equity and inclusion: Addressing systemic barriers at their roots.
- Accountability: Measuring impact and learning continuously.
### Our Story
Founded in 2023, Delta Bay Impact grew from deep listening within local schools and communities. Our early pilot demonstrated that when students feel seen, supported, and connected, engagement and confidence improve. DBI was created to build on that success—at scale and in partnership with schools and families.
