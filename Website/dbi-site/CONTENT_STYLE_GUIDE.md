# Delta Bay Impact Content Style Guide

**Purpose**: Ensure consistency in voice, tone, and optimization across all website content  
**Audience**: Content editors, marketers, board members writing copy

---

## Voice & Tone

### Our Voice
Delta Bay Impact is:
- **Empowering** - We believe in students' potential
- **Action-oriented** - We focus on what works, right now
- **Community-centered** - We partner, not prescribe
- **Results-driven** - We measure impact and share outcomes

We are NOT:
- Problem-obsessed or deficit-focused
- Jargon-heavy or academic
- Organization-centric ("we do X") without showing student benefit
- Vague about outcomes

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Students First, Always

**❌ Don't say**:
"Delta Bay Impact provides culturally responsive programs."

**✅ Do say**:
"Students gain confidence and excel academically through our culturally responsive programs."

**Why**: Put the beneficiary first, not the organization.

---

### 2. Show Outcomes, Not Just Methods

**❌ Don't say**:
"We offer tutoring services."

**✅ Do say**:
"Students boost grades and build skills through personalized tutoring."

**Why**: Benefits matter more than features.

---

### 3. Active Voice, Present Tense

**❌ Don't say**:
"Support is provided by mentors to students."

**✅ Do say**:
"Mentors help students build confidence and improve grades."

**Why**: Active voice is 40% more engaging and easier to scan.

---

### 4. Concrete Over Abstract

**❌ Don't say**:
"We create pathways to opportunity rooted in belonging."

**✅ Do say**:
"Students build confidence, improve grades, and discover their potential."

**Why**: Specific outcomes are more credible and memorable.

---

### 5. Geographic Specificity

**Always include location** when:
- Talking about who we serve
- Writing meta descriptions
- Creating headlines
- Addressing the community

**✅ Good examples**:
- "African American students in Contra Costa County"
- "Bay Point, Concord, and Pittsburg schools"
- "Serving Riverview Middle, Olympic High, and Wren Elementary"

**Why**: SEO for local searches, shows focused mission

---

## Keyword Strategy

### Primary Keywords (Use Naturally)
1. African American students
2. Contra Costa County
3. Educational equity
4. Student mentorship
5. Academic support

### Secondary Keywords
6. Bay Point / Pittsburg / Concord
7. School partnerships
8. Family engagement
9. Culturally responsive
10. Student success

### Avoid Keyword Stuffing
✅ Natural: "We support African American students in Contra Costa County schools."  
❌ Stuffed: "African American students in Contra Costa County get African American student support from Contra Costa County mentors."

---

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Headlines
- **Target**: 6-12 words
- **Structure**: [Who] + [Verb] + [Outcome/Benefit]
- **Examples**:
  - "Every African American Student Deserves to Thrive"
  - "What Students Gain from Working with Us"
  - "Real students. Real schools. Real results."

---

### Body Copy
- **Sentence length**: 15-20 words maximum
- **Paragraph length**: 2-3 sentences, 40-60 words
- **Reading level**: 8th-9th grade (test with Hemingway App)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Active voice used?
- [ ] Specific outcomes named?
- [ ] Geographic keywords included?
- [ ] Jargon removed or explained?
- [ ] One clear idea per paragraph?

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons

**Formula**: [Action Verb] + [Specific Outcome/Benefit]

**❌ Weak CTAs**:
- "Learn more"
- "Click here"
- "Submit"
- "Partner with us"

**✅ Strong CTAs**:
- "See How We Support Students"
- "Discover Programs That Work"
- "Partner with Delta Bay Impact"
- "Get Monthly Impact Stories"
- "Find the Right Program"

**Why**: Specific CTAs increase click-through rate by 15-25%

---

### Descriptions & Summaries

**Service descriptions**:
- Start with outcome/benefit
- Include "students" in first sentence
- Use action verbs
- End with broader impact

**Template**:
"[Students/families] [verb] [specific outcome], [creating/building/achieving] [broader impact]."

**Example**:
"Students boost grades and build skills through personalized tutoring, creating confidence that carries into every subject."

## Conversion Optimization

### Trust Signals to Include
Wherever possible, add:
1. **Numbers**: "500+ students", "3 schools", "Founded 2023"
2. **Names**: Specific schools, partner organizations
3. **Outcomes**: "%improvement", "X students succeeded"
4. **Social proof**: "Join [X] subscribers", "Trusted by [schools]"
5. **Transparency**: 501(c)(3) status, EIN, reports

### Reduce Friction
- One clear CTA per section
- Short forms (3-5 fields maximum)
- No jargon in CTAs
- Mobile-friendly button sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Fast-loading pages

---

## Accessibility Standards

### Writing for Everyone
- [ ] Use headings in logical order (H1 → H2 → H3)
- [ ] Write alt text for all images (descriptive, under 125 characters)
- [ ] Avoid "click here" or "learn more" as link text
- [ ] Use lists for scannable content
- [ ] Ensure 4.5:1 color contrast minimum (text to background)

### Inclusive Language
- **Person-first**: "students with disabilities" not "disabled students"
- **Specific, not generic**: "African American students" not "minority students"
- **Active voice**: "students choose" not "students are given choice"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Problem #1: Too Organization-Centric

**Bad**: "Delta Bay Impact was founded in 2023 to address educational inequity."

**Better**: "Since 2023, African American students in Contra Costa County have gained mentorship, advocacy, and support that helps them thrive."

---

### ❌ Problem #2: Passive Voice Overuse

**Bad**: "Students are supported by mentors in their academic journey."

**Better**: "Mentors help students improve grades, build confidence, and navigate school challenges."

---

### ❌ Problem #3: Vague Outcomes

**Bad**: "We create pathways to success."

**Better**: "Students build confidence, excel academically, and discover their potential."

---

### ❌ Problem #4: Long, Complex Sentences

**Bad**: "We partner with schools, families, and communities to support African American students through mentorship, advocacy, and culturally responsive programs that strengthen well-being, confidence, and academic success while creating pathways to opportunity."

**Better**: "Students gain mentorship, advocacy, and culturally responsive support. The result? Improved confidence, better grades, and clear pathways to success."
