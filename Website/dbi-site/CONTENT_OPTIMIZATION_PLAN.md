**Scope**: All homepage content  
**Goal**: Increase engagement, search visibility, and conversion rates

---

## Optimization Framework

### Readability Principles
- **Sentences**: 15-20 words maximum
- **Paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences, ~40-60 words
- **Headings**: Frontload keywords, use numbers where applicable
- **Lists**: Break complex ideas into scannable bullets
- **Active voice**: "We provide" vs. "is provided"

### SEO Principles
- **Keywords**: African American students, Contra Costa County, mentorship, educational equity
- **H1-H6 hierarchy**: Logical, semantic structure
- **Internal links**: 3-5 per page section
- **Alt text**: Descriptive, keyword-rich
- **Schema markup**: Event, FAQ, HowTo opportunities

### Conversion Principles
- **CTAs**: Action verbs, specific outcomes, urgency
- **Social proof**: Numbers, testimonials, trust badges
- **Value proposition**: Lead with benefits, not features
- **Friction reduction**: One clear next step per section
